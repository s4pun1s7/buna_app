# Running & Building the Buna Festival App

This guide covers running the app in development, building for production, and deploying across all supported platforms.

## üöÄ Development

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.8.0) installed and configured
- Platform-specific tools:
  - **Android**: Android Studio with Android SDK
  - **iOS**: Xcode (macOS only)
  - **Web**: Chrome browser
- Firebase configuration completed (see [Firebase Setup](FIREBASE_SETUP.md))

### Running in Development

#### Basic Development
```sh
# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Run on specific platform
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### Development with Feature Flags
```sh
# Enable development tools and debugging features
flutter run --dart-define=DEV_TOOLS=true

# Web with dev tools
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=DEV_TOOLS=true
```

#### Debug Mode Features
When running with `DEV_TOOLS=true`:
- In-app development panel
- Feature flag configuration screen
- Performance metrics display
- Debug logging enabled
- Error simulation tools

### Hot Reload & Hot Restart
```sh
# During development session
r  # Hot reload (preserves state)
R  # Hot restart (resets state)
p  # Toggle performance overlay
o  # Toggle platform (iOS <-> Android simulator)
q  # Quit
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

### Android

#### Debug Build (Development)
```sh
# Create debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Create debug App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --debug
```

#### Release Build (Production)
```sh
# Create release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Create release App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Build with specific flavor
flutter build apk --release --flavor production
```

#### Signing Configuration
For production builds, configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS

#### Debug Build (Development)
```sh
# Build for iOS simulator
flutter build ios --debug --simulator

# Build for iOS device
flutter build ios --debug
```

#### Release Build (Production)
```sh
# Build for App Store
flutter build ios --release

# Build with specific configuration
flutter build ios --release --flavor production
```

#### Xcode Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Configure signing & capabilities
3. Set deployment target (minimum iOS 13.0)
4. Configure app icons and launch screens
5. Archive and distribute through Xcode

### Web

#### Debug Build (Development)
```sh
# Build debug web version
flutter build web --debug

# Build with dev tools enabled
flutter build web --debug --dart-define=DEV_TOOLS=true
```

#### Release Build (Production)
```sh
# Build optimized web version
flutter build web --release

# Build with specific base URL
flutter build web --release --base-href "/buna-app/"

# Build with web renderer
flutter build web --release --web-renderer html
```

#### Web Deployment
Built files are in `build/web/` and can be deployed to:
- Firebase Hosting
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Any static hosting service

## üîß Build Configurations

### Environment Variables
```sh
# Development build
flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=development

# Staging build
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging

# Production build
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Feature Flags in Builds
```sh
# Enable specific features
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENABLE_AR=true

# Disable experimental features
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=false
```

### Build Flavors
The app supports different build flavors:

#### Android Flavors
```sh
# Development flavor
flutter build apk --flavor development

# Staging flavor
flutter build apk --flavor staging

# Production flavor
flutter build apk --flavor production
```

## üì± Platform-Specific Setup

### Android Release Configuration

#### 1. App Signing
Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=your_key_alias
storeFile=../keystore.jks
```

#### 2. ProGuard (Optional)
Enable code obfuscation in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

#### 3. App Bundle Optimization
```sh
# Build optimized App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64
```

### iOS Release Configuration

#### 1. App Store Configuration
- Configure Bundle ID in Xcode
- Set up App Store Connect listing
- Configure app icons and launch screens
- Set deployment target to iOS 13.0

#### 2. Bitcode (if required)
Enable in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj`:
```
Build Settings > Build Options > Enable Bitcode = YES
```

### Web Optimization

#### 1. Performance Optimization
```sh
# Build with split bundles
flutter build web --release --split-debug-info

# Build with tree shaking
flutter build web --release --tree-shake-icons
```

#### 2. PWA Configuration
Configure in `web/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Buna Festival App",
  "short_name": "Buna",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2196F3"
}
```
