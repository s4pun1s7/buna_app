# Dependency Issue Notes

The following dependencies are causing version conflicts in your Flutter project:
- shared_preferences: ^3.2.1
- ar_flutter_plugin: ^1.1.12

To resolve this, you should:
1. Check the latest compatible versions for your Flutter SDK (3.8.1).
2. Visit https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences and https://pub.dev/packages/ar_flutter_plugin to find the latest versions that support your SDK.
3. Update your pubspec.yaml to use those versions, or remove/comment out the problematic dependencies and add them one by one using `flutter pub add <package>`.

If you want, I can attempt to remove both version constraints and add the latest compatible versions for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
