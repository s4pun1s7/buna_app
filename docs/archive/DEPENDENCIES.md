# Dependency Issue Notes

The following dependencies are causing version conflicts in your Flutter project:
- shared_preferences: ^3.2.1
- ar_flutter_plugin: ^1.1.12

To resolve this, you should:
1. Check the latest compatible versions for your Flutter SDK (3.8.1).
2. Visit https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences and https://pub.dev/packages/ar_flutter_plugin to find the latest versions that support your SDK.
3. Update your pubspec.yaml to use those versions, or remove/comment out the problematic dependencies and add them one by one using `flutter pub add <package>`.

If you want, I can attempt to remove both version constraints and add the latest compatible versions for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

# Safe Dependency Update Checklist

1. Backup your project or commit all current changes.
2. Run `flutter pub outdated` to see which dependencies are outdated.
3. Review changelogs for major updates and breaking changes.
4. Update dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` (start with minor/patch, then major).
5. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch updated packages.
6. Run `flutter analyze` to check for code issues.
7. Run all tests (unit, widget, integration) to catch regressions.
8. Manually test key app features.
9. Fix any deprecations or breaking changes.
10. Commit and push your changes with a clear message.
11. Monitor the app after deployment for issues.
