# Buna App Full Codebase Audit Report

## 1. Dead Code, TODOs, and Cleanup
- Multiple TODOs in `lib/widgets/` (barrel files): These are temporary and should be cleaned up once imports are updated.
- `lib/services/api_service.dart`: TODO to move `Artist` model to its own file.
- `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`: Contains mock/demo providers; should be replaced with real API providers.
- `lib/navigation/route_guards.dart`: Contains stubs for future feature flag logic.
- `CLEANUP_PROGRESS.md`: Tracks ongoing cleanup, including dead code and mock removal.

## 2. Assets
- The following assets are included in `pubspec.yaml`:
  - `assets/Buna black.png`
  - `assets/Buna blue.png`
  - `assets/Buna pink.png`
  - `assets/8.jpeg`
  - `assets/BUNA3_BlueStory.png`
- No code references were found for any of these assets in `lib/`, `test/`, or `integration_test/`. They may be unused and could be removed if not referenced elsewhere (e.g., in dynamic asset loading or future features).
- `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` is intentionally left blank; screenshots are not included.

## 3. Tests
- All test files in `test/` and `integration_test/` appear to be relevant to onboarding, error screens, API, and navigation. No mock/demo/placeholder-only tests were found.
- No explicit TODOs or deprecated code in test files.

## 4. Documentation
- Documentation is generally up to date, with a dedicated `docs/` directory and a cleanup progress file.
- Some files (e.g., `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md`) are intentionally blank.
- No major outdated documentation found, but ongoing cleanup is tracked in `CLEANUP_PROGRESS.md`.

## 5. Code Quality & Organization
- Feature flags are well organized in `lib/config/feature_flags.dart`.
- Some temporary or demo code remains in `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart` and widget barrel files.
- No major deprecated API usage found.
- Imports are generally organized, but some files have TODOs for further cleanup.

## 6. Recommendations
- **Remove or replace mock/demo providers** in `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`.
- **Clean up barrel files** in `lib/widgets/` once all imports are updated.
- **Remove unused assets** if not referenced dynamically or planned for future use.
- **Continue tracking cleanup** in `CLEANUP_PROGRESS.md` and address remaining TODOs.
- **Regularly run `flutter analyze`** to catch unused imports, dead code, and style issues.
- **Add/Improve documentation** and comments where needed, especially for new or refactored logic.
