```

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based organization
- Modular architecture
- Consistent naming conventions

### 2. Navigation System ✅ **EXCELLENT**

The app uses GoRouter with a sophisticated navigation setup:

**Key Components:**
- `AppRouter` - Main router configuration with lazy loading
- `RouteConstants` - Centralized route definitions
- `MainLayout` - Shell layout wrapper
- `RouteGuards` - Route protection and redirects
- `RouteObserver` - Analytics and navigation tracking

**Features:**
- Lazy loading for heavy screens (QR, AR, Map Gallery, Social)
- Feature flag-based route enabling/disabling
- Shell routing with bottom navigation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Analytics integration

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider implementing route preloading for better performance
2. Add route caching for frequently accessed screens
3. Implement deep linking validation

### 3. State Management ✅ **VERY GOOD**

The app uses Riverpod for state management with well-structured providers:

**Provider Architecture:**
- `ThemeProvider` - Theme mode management with persistence
- `LocaleProvider` - Language switching
- `FestivalDataProvider` - Festival data (news, events, venues)
- `FavoritesProvider` - User preferences
- `ScheduleProvider` - Event scheduling
- `SearchProvider` - Search functionality

**State Management Patterns:**
- StateNotifierProvider for complex state
- FutureProvider for async operations
- Family providers for parameterized data
- Proper error handling with AsyncValue

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement state persistence for offline usage
2. Add optimistic updates for better UX
3. Consider implementing state hydration/dehydration

### 4. Services Architecture ✅ **EXCELLENT**

Well-structured service layer with clear responsibilities:

**Core Services:**
- `ApiService` - WordPress REST API integration
- `CacheService` - Intelligent data caching

## Technical Debt Analysis

### 1. Minor Issues Identified

**API Service:**
- API is currently disabled (`_apiDisabled = true`)
- Mock data being used instead of real API
- TODO comments for missing implementations

**Navigation:**
- Some route detail screens are placeholder implementations
- Missing deep linking validation

**Google Maps Integration:**
- Using `google_maps_flutter` for all map and marker functionality in Flutter
- No direct usage of Google Maps JavaScript API in Dart code
- Recent deprecation warning for `google.maps.Marker` (JS API) does **not** affect current Flutter code
- No migration needed for markers in Flutter; safe from JS API deprecation
- Missing deep linking validation

**Localization:**
- ARB files need to be generated (`flutter gen-l10n`)
- Some hardcoded strings still present

### 2. Dependency Management
- Modern Flutter dependencies
- Proper version constraints
- Some commented-out dependencies (AR plugin)
